    <p>I encountered challlenges when figuring what inputs the gates can recieve,</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>This experience could be improved by a more extensive lesson.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>

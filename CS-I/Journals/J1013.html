    <p>I received assistance from: Abhiram Reddy</p>
    <p>I assisted: Daniel Brinn</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 1</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction ≠?</h3>
    <p>It will be true if both values are true and also if both are not true.</p> <br>

    <h2>Section 2</h2>
    <h3>Question 1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2ⁿ?</h3>
    <p>You will recieve out what ever that is being inputed as it's almost a cause and effect. </p> <br>

    <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
    <p>I learned about boolean algebra functions and truth tables. </p> <br>

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    <p>I had trouble understanding how the truth table correspond with each other.</p> <br>

    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    <p>I would prefer a more detailed explananation and demonstration.</p> <br>

    <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    <p>I have now realized how we can use this in the real world.</p>
